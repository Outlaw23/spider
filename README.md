### Brief explanation

In my spider project, I'm creating translate for my own language called Hado (not a coding language). 
I'm still learning, so I'm tackling new topics that I haven't explored yet with Java.

#### Hado translate screen
on the hado screen the top field is for your own language if you click on translate 
it will be set to Hado language in the bottom field.

#### HadoR translate screen
On HadoR screen you can set Hado language back to your own language,
it works the same as on the Hado Screen.
